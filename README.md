## gene1
lipoate-protien ligase A:an enzyme with systematic name ATP:lipoate adenylyltransferase.

## gene2
magnesium transporter: a protien that trasnports magnesium across the cell membrane.

## gene3
aspartate carbamoyltransferase, catalytic subunit: catalizes the first step in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. It is a multi-subunit protein complex composed of 12 subunits.

## gene4
maltodextrin phosphorylase: Phosphorylase is an important allosteric enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism. Enzymes from different sources differ in their regulatory mechanisms and in their natural substrates. However, all known phosphorylases share catalytic and structural properties.

## gene 5
cysteine desulfurase: Cysteine desulfurase proteins play a central role in the delivery of sulphur to a variety of metabolic pathways. It is involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulphur clusters, thio-nucleosides in tRNA, thiamine, biotin, lipoate and pyranopterin.
